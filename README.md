Note: The API this was built on was deprecated so you'd need to find a fresh crypto API for this to run

Make your own digital currency feed and log the results to your own database!

Uses the Coin Market Cap API to pull in a list of digital currencies then has a simple PHP statement log the values to a database.

The heavy lifting of this project was to set up a database, write a SQL command to input the relevant data from the API into the database, then set the command to run once a day by means of a cron job.
